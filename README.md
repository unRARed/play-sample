# Play Sample - A Windsurf "Vibe Coding" Experiment

## About This Project

This project was created as part of a Windsurf "Vibe Coding" experiment to showcase the capabilities of AI-assisted coding. Play Sample is an interactive web application built with Ruby on Rails 8 that allows users to create and interact with a customizable sample pad interface.

## What is "Vibe Coding"?

"Vibe Coding" is a collaborative approach to software development where a human provides high-level guidance and creative direction, while an AI assistant (Cascade by Windsurf) handles the implementation details. This approach enables rapid prototyping and development of functional applications with minimal coding effort from the human participant.

## Project Features

- Multi-user authentication system with secure signup/login flows
- Interactive sample pad grid with 16 customizable buttons
- Audio file upload and playback functionality
- Real-time audio controls (play, stop individual samples, stop all)
- Customizable sample properties (color, label, play mode)
- Modern, responsive UI built with Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI
- Hotwire and Turbo for seamless, SPA-like experience

## Technical Stack

- Ruby on Rails 8.0.2
- Ruby 3.4.1
- SQLite database with Litestream for replication
- Tailwind CSS with DaisyUI "sunset" theme
- Hotwire, Turbo, and Stimulus for frontend interactivity
- Active Storage for file handling
- RSpec for testing

## Development History

The complete development history and requirements evolution can be found in the [PROMPTS.md](PROMPTS.md) file, which tracks the conversation between the human guide and the AI assistant throughout the project's creation.
